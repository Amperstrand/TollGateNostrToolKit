To incorporate the new version of your custom feed into your OpenWrt build system, specifically for building the `gltollgate` package with updates from your feed, you need to update the OpenWrt build system's configuration to point to the latest commit of your custom feed. Here are the steps you need to follow:

### 1. Update the `feeds.conf` File

The `feeds.conf` file in your OpenWrt directory specifies the sources for all the package feeds used by your build system. You'll need to update the entry for your custom feed to point to the latest commit or ensure it pulls the latest by using the branch name. If you're using a specific commit, here's how you can specify it:

- **Using the Latest Commit Hash:**
  ```conf
  src-git custom https://github.com/yourusername/secp256k1_openwrt_feed.git^1d7d80687a5be30015d4852ca1f86a405acb51fa
  ```

- **Using the Branch Name:**
  If you want to always pull the latest from a specific branch (e.g., `main`), you can set it up like this:
  ```conf
  src-git custom https://github.com/yourusername/secp256k1_openwrt_feed.git;main
  ```

Replace `https://github.com/yourusername/secp256k1_openwrt_feed.git` with the actual URL of your git repository.

### 2. Update and Install the Feeds

After updating the `feeds.conf` file, run the following commands from the root of your OpenWrt build directory to update the feeds and install the necessary packages:

```bash
./scripts/feeds update -a  # Update all feeds
./scripts/feeds install -a # Install all packages from all feeds
```

This process will fetch the latest versions of the packages specified in your custom feed and prepare them for building.

### 3. Configure OpenWrt to Include the Package

Ensure that the `gltollgate` package is selected in the OpenWrt configuration:

- Run `make menuconfig`
- Navigate to the section where your package is located (Utilities, if following your Makefile)
- Check the package `gltollgate` to be included in the build
- Save and exit the configuration menu

### 4. Build the Package

You can now build the `gltollgate` package using the following command:

```bash
make package/gltollgate/compile V=s
```

This command focuses on just rebuilding the `gltollgate` package with verbose logging enabled (`V=s`), which helps in debugging if any errors arise.

### 5. Check for Build Success

After the build process completes, check the output for any errors. If the build is successful, the compiled package should be in the `bin/packages/` directory of your OpenWrt build root, under the architecture and feed name you are using.

### Troubleshooting

If there are issues during the build:

- Review build logs to identify the cause of failures.
- Make sure all dependencies of `gltollgate` are also updated and available.
- Ensure that the paths and references in your Makefiles are correct, especially if they depend on other packages or resources.

Updating the commit hash in your `feeds.conf` and ensuring that your OpenWrt build environment is updated with the latest changes from your feed are critical steps in maintaining an up-to-date and functional build environment.
